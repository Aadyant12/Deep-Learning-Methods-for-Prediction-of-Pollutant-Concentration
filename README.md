# Predicting-Pollutant-Concentration
_Done under the guidance of **Prof. Farnaz Hosseinpour - Desert Research Institute, University of Nevada, Reno**_

This project is aimed at predicting PM2.5 particle concentration over the state of Nevada, USA. The fact that there is a yearly rise in the concentration during certain months of the year, forms the basis of this project. Multiple types of neural networks including dense neural network, recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network were tried in this project

The data was collected from United States Environmental Protection Agency.
